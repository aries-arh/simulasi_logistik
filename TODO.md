- [x] Test parallel vehicle operations in integrated simulation
- [x] Fix destination location mapping for integrated mode (override to 'ASSEMBLY')
- [x] Fix integrated_mode attribute initialization
- [x] Remove incorrect scaling in BOM quantity parsing
- [x] Vehicles are now active and processing tasks correctly in integrated simulation
